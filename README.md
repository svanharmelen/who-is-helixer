# who-is-helixer

Hi there!

So this is probably the weirdest way that I ever tried to get into contact with
someone, but here goes anyway :D

I know this is an extreme long shot, but if I'm not mistaking this should trigger
(depending on the account setup) an email to the person who owns the GitHub
handle `helixer`.

It seems the `helixer` account has never been actively used, but of course it
could very well be used to work on private repos (which I cannot see). So I was
very curious if indeed the account isn't used and if so, if there is any chance
that you would be willing to give up the account?

I would really love to use the name helixer and it seems such a shame that the
name just sits there doing nothing now (again, at least it look like that from
the outside ;)

Really hope this weird way of contacting you works out and that you can find
a minute to respond. Even just a `NO` would be super much appreciated as then I
at least know this message reached you :)

Thanks!!!!
